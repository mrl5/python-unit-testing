# [Unit Testing]
Examples from chapter 9 of [Dive Into Python 3] by [Mark Pilgrim]

>Unit testing is an important part of an overall testing-centric development strategy. If you write unit tests, it is important to write them early and to keep them updated as code and requirements change. Many people advocate writing tests before they write the code they’re testing (...) unit tests are beneficial no matter when you write them.

>A test case should be able to
>- run completely by itself, without any human input. Unit testing is about automation.
>- determine by itself whether the function it is testing has passed or failed, without a human interpreting the results.
>- run in isolation, separate from any other test cases (even if they test the same functions). Each test case is an island

## Introduction to the task
>Let’s start mapping out what a roman.py module should do. It will have two main functions, to_roman() and from_roman(). The to_roman() function should take an integer from 1 to 3999 and return the Roman numeral representation as a string

## Task
>Write a test case that checks whether the to_roman() function does what you want it to. You read that right: you’re going to write code that tests code that you haven’t written yet.
